# LOG.md — completed chunks, newest last

Append-only. Entry header: `<lane>-<number> | complete|partial | <date or unknown>`.
Next number = highest in the header lines below + 1 (see START_HERE.md).
Files: A=added M=modified D=deleted, from a real diff of uploaded vs. returned project.

B-001 | complete | 2026-10-05
Task: Phase 0 coordination setup (docs only, no site code touched).
Files:
- M ARCHITECTURE.md
- D CHANGELOG.md
- D DECISIONS.md
- A LOG.md
- D PROJECT_STATUS.md
- A START_HERE.md
- D TODO.md
- A docs-archive/CHANGELOG.md
- A docs-archive/DECISIONS.md
- A docs-archive/PROJECT_STATUS.md
- A docs-archive/TODO.md
Changed:
- Created START_HERE.md and LOG.md.
- Moved DECISIONS.md, PROJECT_STATUS.md, TODO.md, CHANGELOG.md into
  docs-archive/ (content unchanged except a one-line ARCHIVED banner on top).
- Added a one-paragraph note at the top of ARCHITECTURE.md pointing to the new
  layout and flagging its theming text as pre-redesign.
- Cross-checked this ZIP against the previous one: only VISUAL_REDESIGN.md,
  css/style.css, js/data/builds.js and js/data/gallery.js differed; their
  changes are summarized in START_HERE.md "Current state".
- Read-only finding: services.html cannot be removed yet (owner queue item 1).
Decision: none
Verified: stitch.py output identical to the committed root HTML and sitemap.xml;
  smoke-test not run (docs-only chunk, no code changed).
Next/open: services.html removal waits on the owner (START_HERE.md owner queue).

B-002 | complete | 2026-10-05
Task: Record Lane A's closing summary and reconcile it with the ZIP (docs only).
Files:
- M LOG.md
- M START_HERE.md
Changed:
- Lane A's summary (received after B-001): nothing decided but unwritten; open
  items are the nav-dropdown shadow check and layout-transition, both already in
  VISUAL_REDESIGN.md; smoke-test reported passing.
- Reconciled: every file that differs between the two ZIPs is on Lane A's edited
  list, and no other file differed. Its "97 files" counts ZIP entries including
  folders (88 files).
- START_HERE.md: removed the "unknown" owner-queue item, added the summary to
  Current state, added layout-transition detail to Next up A, noted that
  smoke-test cannot run in Lane B's sandbox.
Decision: none
Verified: smoke-test not run (jsdom missing in this sandbox, no network); Lane A
  reports it passing on the same site code. No site files changed since B-001.
Next/open: services.html removal still waits on the owner (START_HERE.md owner queue).

B-003 | complete | 2026-10-05
Task: Remove the Services page and everything tied to it (owner no longer offers services).
Files:
- M 404.html
- M ARCHITECTURE.md
- M LOG.md
- M START_HERE.md
- M VISUAL_REDESIGN.md
- M about.html
- M build.html
- M builds.html
- M contact.html
- M css/services.css
- M custom-build.html
- M faq.html
- M gallery.html
- M index.html
- D js/data/services.js
- M js/partials/footer.html

- D pages-src/services.html
- M part-boxes.html
- D services.html
- M sitemap.xml
- M smoke-test.js
- M visual-check.py
Changed:
- Deleted services.html, pages-src/services.html, js/data/services.js,
  js/render/serviceCard.js.
- Removed the Services link from the header (desktop and mobile) and footer
  partials, and the contact page's "PC Service / Repair" card (picker 6 -> 5).
- css/services.css trimmed to the one class contact.html still uses
  (.service-hub-card); file and class names kept for now.
- smoke-test.js: dropped the services check, picker expectation 6 -> 5.
  visual-check.py: dropped the services entry.
- Fixed stale comments naming services.html (contactRouter.js, notifyBox.js,
  partBoxOrder.js, pages-src/part-boxes.html), the ARCHITECTURE.md file listing,
  and the VISUAL_REDESIGN.md scope note.
- Rebuilt with stitch.py: 10 pages, sitemap has 9 URLs (404 excluded, no
  services). Rebuilt pages differ from B-002 only by the removed links/card.
- Left in place on purpose, awaiting owner approval (START_HERE.md owner queue
  item 1): repair wording in about.html (3 spots) and the homepage structured
  data description in build-tools/stitch.py.
Decision: Owner decided to stop offering services; remove the page and all links to it.
Verified: all local links/assets in the 10 built pages resolve; no references
  to removed files outside docs-archive/; node --check passes on every JS file
  and py_compile on both Python scripts. smoke-test not run (jsdom unavailable
  in this sandbox), so the 6 -> 5 picker assertion is unverified at run time.
Next/open: owner item 1 (wording approvals). Run smoke-test.js locally before
  the next push.

B-004 | complete | 2026-10-05
Task: Remove the remaining repair wording (owner approved all four edits as proposed in B-003).
Files:
- M LOG.md
- M START_HERE.md
- M about.html
- M build-tools/stitch.py
- M index.html
- M pages-src/about.html
Changed:
- pages-src/about.html: dropped "and repair" from the meta description (this
  also feeds the og: and twitter: descriptions in the built page), "and
  repairs" from the school paragraph, and "or a repair question" from the
  bottom call-to-action (now "a listed system or a custom build").
- build-tools/stitch.py: homepage structured-data description is now "Gaming PC
  sales and custom builds in Southern Oregon."
- Rebuilt with stitch.py; only about.html and index.html changed, on those
  lines only.
- Left alone on purpose: the FAQ's after-purchase email troubleshooting, its
  upgrade answer, the "Cleaned" testing step, and the FAQ line saying support is
  "not a warranty program or a repair service" (still accurate).
- START_HERE.md: owner item 1 resolved and removed; Lane B list and state updated.
Decision: Owner approved all four wording edits.
Verified: all local links/assets in the 10 built pages resolve, no unreplaced
  markers, stitch.py compiles; only the expected lines differ from B-003. No
  "repair" remains in site code except the FAQ disclaimer above. smoke-test not
  run (jsdom unavailable here).
Next/open: run smoke-test.js locally before pushing (still unrun since the B-003
  picker change).

B-005 | complete | 2026-10-06
Task: Correct the outdated test-environment notes after Lane A reported how it runs the tests.
Files:
- M LOG.md
- M START_HERE.md
- M smoke-test.js
- M visual-check.py
Changed:
- smoke-test.js header: removed the claim that Playwright's browser cannot be
  used in the sandbox; added setup (`npm install jsdom --no-save`, needs the npm
  registry) and "report not run, never a pass".
- visual-check.py header: Chromium is pre-installed at /opt/pw-browsers and both
  the Python and Node bindings launch it; the earlier failure was only the
  `npx playwright install chromium` download step, which is not needed.
- START_HERE.md Tests section rewritten with both tools, which one needs network,
  the screenshots/ warning, and a note that the docs-archive D24 / PROJECT_STATUS
  statements are outdated. The archive itself stays frozen.
- Lane B's earlier "no jsdom and no network" was true of that sandbox only; it
  is account/sandbox dependent, not a project limit.
Decision: none
Verified: Chromium launched from both Python and Node here. visual-check.py run
  on a scratch copy: 9 pages x 3 viewports, no horizontal overflow. Ad-hoc
  Playwright pass on the same copy: 10 pages, 0 script errors, 0 links to
  services, contact picker shows 5 cards. smoke-test.js itself still not run
  (jsdom absent, npm registry returns 403 in this sandbox). node --check and
  py_compile pass on the edited scripts. Screenshots were made on the scratch
  copy and are not in the ZIP.
Next/open: run smoke-test.js where the npm registry is reachable (Lane A's
  sandbox) or locally, before the next push.

A-006 | complete | 2026-10-06
Task: Custom-build tier-card feature lists (Lane A visual decision; owner approved Option B).
Files:
- M LOG.md
- M START_HERE.md
- M VISUAL_REDESIGN.md
- M css/style.css
Changed:
- css/style.css: `.tier-features` now has `padding: 0` (it kept the browser's
  default 40px indent), a top hairline and `flex: 1`; its `li` rows are
  hairline-divided with no check marks (the `::before` rule, the old `gap` and
  the `li` flex layout are gone). `flex: 1` moved from `.tier-desc` to
  `.tier-features` so the top rules line up across the three cards. No markup
  change; pages-src/ and the generated root HTML are unchanged.
- VISUAL_REDESIGN.md: new "Tier-card feature lists" subsection (options A/B/C,
  reasoning, measurements, tablet limitation, two noticed-but-undecided items);
  "How this process works" notes artifacts are allowed for showing options;
  Scope notes entry for custom-build corrected (it said "4 open items pending"
  though all four were already resolved).
- START_HERE.md: updated Current state, Next up (Lane A), Lane A role line, and
  Tests (smoke-test ran here; sandbox cannot reach Google Fonts, how to get
  real fonts for mockups).
Decision: Owner chose Option B (ruled rows, no check marks) over A (aligned
  check marks) and C (mono spec-sheet). Owner also OK'd using artifacts to show
  options in future.
Verified: stitch.py ran (exit 0), root HTML and sitemap.xml identical to B-005.
  smoke-test.js (jsdom installed, npm reachable here): ALL CHECKS PASSED.
  visual-check.py on a scratch copy: no horizontal overflow on any page at
  desktop/tablet/mobile. Playwright on the real page at 1440/1024/768/390: list
  text x equals badge x in every card, `padding-left` 0, no `::before` content,
  0 script errors. Top rules align across cards at 1440 (2012px) and 1024
  (2024px); at 768 the two first-row cards differ by 24px (one description wraps
  to 4 lines, the other to 3) - not fixed. Screenshots and mockups were made on
  scratch copies and are not in the ZIP.
Next/open: custom-build still has the noticed-but-undecided process-section left
  column alignment; tablet-width rule alignment (subgrid) goes in the tablet
  pass; the sitewide scan findings (nav-dropdown shadow check, layout-transition)
  are unchanged.

A-007 | complete | 2026-10-06
Task: Custom-build "How a Custom Build Works" left column alignment (Lane A visual decision; owner approved Option A).
Files (diff against the A-006 ZIP returned earlier in this chat):
- M LOG.md
- M START_HERE.md
- M VISUAL_REDESIGN.md
- M custom-build.html
- M pages-src/custom-build.html
Changed:
- pages-src/custom-build.html: the process section's wrapper is now
  `<div class="two-col">` instead of `<div class="two-col center">`, plus a short
  HTML comment saying why. Plain `.two-col` already has `align-items: start`, so no
  CSS change was needed; `.two-col.center` is still used by the home page's Custom
  Builds section and is untouched.
- custom-build.html regenerated with stitch.py (differs from A-006 only by that
  class and the comment).
- VISUAL_REDESIGN.md: new "Process section left column" subsection (options A/B/C,
  measurements, reasoning, implementation, verification); Scope notes updated; the
  "noticed" paragraph under the tier-card subsection now points to it.
- START_HERE.md: Current state, Next up (Lane A) updated.
Decision: Owner chose Option A (top-align) over B (header top, button bottom) and C
  (header row over a 2x3 step grid). Options were shown as a published artifact
  (owner had OK'd artifacts in A-006).
Verified: stitch.py exit 0. smoke-test.js (jsdom installed here): ALL CHECKS PASSED.
  visual-check.py on a scratch copy: no horizontal overflow on any page at
  desktop/tablet/mobile. Playwright on the real page at 1440/1180/1024/901/768/390:
  0 script errors; at 1440, 1180, 1024 and 901 the left column's top equals the
  list's top and the label sits 5px below the first rule; at 768 and 390 the section
  is one column as before. Home page's `.two-col.center` still computes
  `align-items: center`. Screenshots and the options page were made on scratch
  copies and are not in the ZIP.
Next/open: custom-build's "Not Sure What Hardware You Need?" section only got the
  header rollout and has not been reviewed; tablet-width tier-card rule alignment
  (subgrid) still goes in the tablet pass; sitewide scan findings (nav-dropdown
  shadow check, layout-transition) unchanged.

A-008 | complete | 2026-10-06
Task: Custom-build "Not Sure What Hardware You Need?" section layout (Lane A visual decision; owner approved Option A).
Files (diff against the A-007 ZIP returned earlier in this chat):
- M LOG.md
- M START_HERE.md
- M VISUAL_REDESIGN.md
- M css/style.css
- M custom-build.html
- M pages-src/custom-build.html
Changed:
- pages-src/custom-build.html: the section's inline `max-width:760px; margin:0 auto`
  block is now `<div class="two-col">`: header (with `style="margin-bottom:0;"`,
  `<h2 class="text-balance">`) in the left div, the two paragraphs and the button
  row in the right div, plus a short HTML comment. Copy unchanged. The right
  column's first paragraph has `margin-top:0` (see Decision note below).
- css/style.css: new opt-in utility `.text-balance { text-wrap: balance; }` with a
  comment; used only on that h2, so no other heading changes.
- custom-build.html regenerated with stitch.py; no other root file changed.
- VISUAL_REDESIGN.md: new "Not Sure section layout" subsection; Scope notes updated
  (custom-build is done apart from deferred items).
- START_HERE.md: Current state and Next up (Lane A) updated.
Decision: Owner chose Option A (two columns on the page grid) over B (single column,
  left edge on the grid) and C (centered). Options were shown as a published artifact.
  Deviation to flag: the artifact showed the right column's first line about 18px
  below the label, which I attributed to top-aligned boxes. The real cause was the
  paragraph's default 1em top margin, no longer collapsing inside a grid item. It is
  now `margin-top:0`, so the first line sits level with the label; the collapsed
  spacing is 36px vs. 32px before. Slightly different from the approved mockup.
Verified: stitch.py exit 0. smoke-test.js (jsdom installed here): ALL CHECKS PASSED.
  visual-check.py on a scratch copy: no horizontal overflow on any page at
  desktop/tablet/mobile. Playwright on the real page at 1440/1180/1024/901/768/390:
  0 script errors, no horizontal overflow; two columns down to 901px and one column at
  768/390 as before; section height 469px at 1440 (was 630), 643px at 768 (was 639),
  816px at 390 (was 812). Screenshots and the options page were made on scratch
  copies and are not in the ZIP.
Next/open: custom-build has two deferred items only (tablet-width tier-card rule
  alignment, final CTA box kicker label waits for the copy pass); sitewide scan
  findings (nav-dropdown shadow check, layout-transition) unchanged. Next page to walk:
  about, gallery, faq, contact or part-boxes (owner picks order).

A-009 | complete | 2026-10-07
Task: Contact page situation picker layout and the leftover-name rename (Lane A visual decision; owner approved Option B and the rename).
Files (diff against the A-008 ZIP returned earlier in this chat):
- M ARCHITECTURE.md
- M LOG.md
- M START_HERE.md
- M VISUAL_REDESIGN.md
- M contact.html
- D css/services.css
- A css/situation-picker.css
- M css/style.css
- M pages-src/contact.html
- M smoke-test.js
Changed:
- css/situation-picker.css (new, replaces the deleted css/services.css): picker is a
  hairline-ruled list; each `.situation-option` is a 2-column grid (title + description,
  button), last row open, h3/p default margins zeroed (they stacked with the flex gap
  and put 44px between title and text), `text-wrap: pretty` on the description,
  button `min-width: 12.5rem`; at 640px and below rows stack with the button below.
- pages-src/contact.html: stylesheet link now css/situation-picker.css; picker container
  `<div class="situation-picker" id="situation-picker">` (was `grid-2`); the five
  `.service-hub-card` divs are `.situation-option`. Copy and data attributes unchanged.
- contact.html regenerated with stitch.py; no other root file changed.
- smoke-test.js: picker selector `.situation-option`; new assertion that no
  `.service-hub-card` markup remains.
- ARCHITECTURE.md file listing and a historical comment in css/style.css use the new
  names. LOG.md (this file's older entries) and docs-archive/ keep the old names.
- VISUAL_REDESIGN.md: new "Contact page" section with the picker decision; Scope notes
  updated. START_HERE.md: Current state and Next up updated, old rename note removed.
Decision: Owner chose Option B (ruled rows) over A (cards, last spans the row) and C
  (three cards + two rows), and approved the rename. Options were shown as a published
  artifact. Deviation to flag: the class is `.situation-option`, not `.situation-card`
  (suggested earlier), because the items are rows now.
Verified: stitch.py exit 0. smoke-test.js (jsdom installed here): ALL CHECKS PASSED,
  including the 5-option picker and the new old-markup-gone assertion. visual-check.py on
  a scratch copy: no horizontal overflow on any page at desktop/tablet/mobile. All local
  links/assets in the 10 built pages resolve. Playwright on the real page at
  1440/1024/901/768/641/640/390: 0 script errors, no horizontal overflow; at 1440 the
  picker is 542px (was 832) with a 4px title-to-text gap and five 200px buttons on one
  right edge; clicking each of the four form buttons reveals the expected panel and the
  Part Box button still links to part-boxes.html. Screenshots and the options page were
  made on scratch copies and are not in the ZIP.
Next/open: rest of the contact page (three form panels and the shared .form-input /
  .form-label / .form-privacy fields, thank-you state) is not walked yet; at 640px and
  below the two button widths differ (148px / 196px), left as is for the mobile pass;
  custom-build deferred items and the sitewide scan findings are unchanged.

A-010 | complete | 2026-10-07
Task: Contact page form panels - width, placement and internals (Lane A visual decision; owner approved Option A).
Files (diff against the A-009 ZIP returned earlier in this chat):
- M LOG.md
- M START_HERE.md
- M VISUAL_REDESIGN.md
- M contact.html
- M css/style.css
- M pages-src/contact.html
Changed:
- pages-src/contact.html: the three submit buttons no longer carry inline
  `width:100%; justify-content:center;`. Copy unchanged.
- css/style.css (next to the .form-privacy rules, with a comment): panel intro paragraph
  capped at 52ch; privacy-note paragraph margin removed inside `.situation-form-panel`
  (box 81px -> 56px at 1440); at 640px and below the submit button is full width again
  so phones keep the full-width button they had before.
- contact.html regenerated with stitch.py (differs from A-009 only by the removed
  inline button style); no other root file changed.
- VISUAL_REDESIGN.md: new "Form panel width and placement" subsection; Scope notes updated.
  START_HERE.md: Current state and Next up updated, owner decision pending noted.
Decision: Owner chose Option A (panel stays full width, internals fixed) over B (panel in
  the picker's column) and C (760px on the page grid). Options were shown as a published
  artifact. Deviation to flag: the mobile full-width button at 640px and below was not in
  the mockup; it keeps the pre-change mobile behavior.
Verified: stitch.py exit 0. smoke-test.js (jsdom installed here): ALL CHECKS PASSED.
  visual-check.py on a scratch copy: no horizontal overflow on any page at
  desktop/tablet/mobile. All local links/assets in the 10 built pages resolve. Playwright on
  the real page at 1440/1024/768/390 (button also at 641/640): clicking each of the three form
  buttons shows exactly its panel; 0 script errors, no horizontal overflow; at 1440 panel
  1132px, intro 468px wide, button 187px, privacy box 56px; button 190px at 641px and full
  width at 640px and 390px. Screenshots and the options page were made on scratch copies
  and are not in the ZIP. Not run: actually submitting a form (it would POST to the form
  service).
Next/open: owner decision pending - the notify box on builds.html (privacy box measured 102px)
  and the build-detail form have the same default-margin bug; a root fix to `.form-privacy p`
  would change those signed-off pages. Rest of the contact page not walked yet: shared form
  fields (.form-input, .form-label, .form-select, focus ring) and the thank-you state. With JS
  off the three panels stack with no gap (noticed, not touched).

A-011 | complete | 2026-10-07
Task: Apply the privacy-note margin fix at the root `.form-privacy p` rule (owner approved; it was the pending decision from A-010).
Files (diff against the A-010 ZIP returned earlier in this chat):
- M LOG.md
- M START_HERE.md
- M VISUAL_REDESIGN.md
- M css/style.css
Changed:
- css/style.css: `margin: 0` added to `.form-privacy p` (with a comment). The scoped
  `.situation-form-panel .form-privacy p` rule added in A-010 was removed as redundant, and
  the contact block's comment now points at the root rule. No markup, JS or generated-HTML
  change (stitch.py output is identical to A-010).
- This also changes two pages signed off earlier: the notify box on builds.html
  (js/render/notifyBox.js) and the build-detail inquiry form (js/render/buildDetail.js).
- VISUAL_REDESIGN.md: new "Privacy-note margin fix extended to the root rule" subsection; the
  A-010 text that said the fix was scoped and pending was updated. START_HERE.md: Current state
  and Next up updated (pending decision removed).
Decision: Owner approved applying the fix at the root, so all three places get it.
Verified: stitch.py exit 0, generated files unchanged. smoke-test.js (jsdom installed here):
  ALL CHECKS PASSED. visual-check.py on a scratch copy: no horizontal overflow on any page at
  desktop/tablet/mobile. Playwright before -> after, 1440px / 390px: notify box on builds.html
  102px -> 77px / 123px -> 98px; build-detail form 102px -> 77px / 123px -> 98px (measured in
  scratch copies with aug26-02 set to available, because the form only renders for an available
  listing and every real listing is sold; real data unchanged); contact panels 56px / 98px,
  unchanged. 0 script errors and no horizontal overflow on builds, the detail page and contact
  at both widths. Screenshots of the notify box and the detail form looked right. Screenshots and
  scratch copies are not in the ZIP.
Next/open: rest of the contact page (shared form fields .form-input, .form-label, .form-select,
  focus ring; thank-you state) not walked yet; with JS off the three contact panels stack with
  no gap (noticed, not touched); custom-build deferred items and the sitewide scan findings
  unchanged.

A-012 | complete | 2026-10-07
Task: Shared form fields - resting boundary, focus state, select arrow (Lane A visual decision; owner approved Option A).
Files (diff against the A-011 ZIP returned earlier in this chat):
- M LOG.md
- M START_HERE.md
- M VISUAL_REDESIGN.md
- M css/style.css
- M css/theme.css
Changed:
- css/theme.css: new token `--border-field: #6a665e` (with a comment); the `:focus` box-shadow glow
  override for .form-input/.form-select/.form-textarea was REMOVED (theme.css loads after style.css and
  would have kept the glow), with a comment in its place.
- css/style.css: the three field classes use `border: 1px solid var(--border-field)`; the `:focus` rule
  is `border-color: var(--accent-text); box-shadow: none; outline: 1px solid var(--accent-text);
  outline-offset: 0` (one solid 2px accent edge, no glow); select arrow fill `%238f8a7d` (--dim)
  instead of the old blue-gray `%2364748b`. Comments added.
- No markup or JS change; stitch.py output is identical to A-011. The change applies to every page that
  renders these fields: contact panels, build-detail inquiry form, notify box on builds.html and the
  part-boxes order form.
- VISUAL_REDESIGN.md: new "Form fields" subsection; Scope notes updated. START_HERE.md: Current state
  and Next up updated.
Decision: Owner chose Option A (visible border, solid focus edge) over B (underline fields) and C (keep the
  quiet look, unify focus). Options were shown as a published artifact. Deviation to flag: the offset
  ring I first showed for focus read as a busy double ring, so A uses a solid 2px edge (border plus
  outline, no offset) instead.
Verified: stitch.py exit 0, generated files unchanged. smoke-test.js (jsdom installed here): ALL CHECKS
  PASSED. visual-check.py on a scratch copy: no horizontal overflow on any page at desktop/tablet/mobile.
  Real browser before -> after: resting border rgb(44,44,48) -> rgb(106,102,94), contrast against the card
  1.29:1 -> 3.13:1 (computed from the token colors); after the focus transition (400ms), every input, select
  and textarea on contact, the notify box and the build-detail form (measured in a scratch copy with
  aug26-02 set to available, real data unchanged) has border rgb(174,121,142), outline solid 1px at offset
  0, box-shadow none; select arrow #64748b -> #8f8a7d; field heights unchanged (45px); 0 script errors. The
  part-boxes order form (revealed by adding a box) shows the same focused style. Screenshots and options
  page were made on scratch copies and are not in the ZIP. Not run: submitting a form. Not measured: the
  field change at 390px specifically.
Next/open: contact's thank-you state is not walked yet; `.qty-input`/`.qty-btn` on part-boxes untouched
  (part-boxes not walked); whether the old focus glow was one of the 9 remaining
  `gpt-thin-border-wide-shadow` hits is unknown (detector not run); custom-build deferred items and the
  other sitewide scan findings unchanged.

A-013 | complete | 2026-10-08

- M css/style.css
- M js/render/buildDetail.js
- M js/render/contactRouter.js
- M js/render/notifyBox.js
Changed:
- css/style.css: new `.success-state` / `.success-mark` / `.success-title` (centered neutral card, check
  in a 56px circle outlined in --accent-text, h2 title, paragraph capped at 52ch, button below;
  `.listing-form-card .success-state` drops its own box; `grid-column: 1 / -1` so it spans the grid the
  notify box sits in). Added after the existing `.notify-success` block, which is kept on purpose (see
  Next/open).
- js/render/contactRouter.js, notifyBox.js, buildDetail.js: the inline-styled / `.notify-success`
  confirmation blocks are replaced by the shared markup (mark has aria-hidden="true"; heading is an h2,
  was an h3 under the h1 on contact and build-detail). On contact it is wrapped in
  `<section class="section"><div class="container">` because #contact-live-region sits directly in <main>.
  Copy, links, buttons, the ?sent=true / ?notified=true triggers and the live regions are unchanged.
- VISUAL_REDESIGN.md: new "Success states" subsection; Scope notes updated (contact complete apart from
  hero copy). START_HERE.md: Current state and Next up updated.
Decision: Owner chose Option B (centered badge in a card) over A (centered, unboxed) and C (left-aligned on
  the grid). Options were shown as a published artifact in three contexts. Deviations to flag: (1) the
  artifact could not show that the notify box sits in a grid; the first implementation rendered a 361px
  card on builds.html, fixed with `grid-column: 1 / -1`; (2) a fourth instance exists that the artifact did
  not show, js/render/partBoxOrder.js (part-boxes order confirmation, inside the sticky .order-summary
  panel), and it was left untouched because part-boxes is not walked yet.
Verified: stitch.py exit 0, generated HTML unchanged. node --check passes on the three JS files.
  smoke-test.js (jsdom installed here): ALL CHECKS PASSED. visual-check.py on a scratch copy: no horizontal
  overflow on any page at desktop/tablet/mobile. Each state rendered for real by its URL parameter
  (contact.html?sent=true, builds.html?notified=true, build.html?id=aug26-02&sent=true) at 1440/768/390: 0
  script errors, no horizontal overflow; at 1440 contact card 1132px wide, builds card 1132px (720px at
  768), build-detail state inside its form card with no box of its own; check mark 5.05:1 against the card
  (old --accent mark 2.53:1); contact heading structure h1 then h2. The build-detail state was checked in a
  scratch copy with aug26-02 set to available because every real listing is sold; real data unchanged.
  part-boxes.html?ordered=true confirmation computes identically before and after (green border, 48px 32px
  padding, 284px tall). Screenshots and the options page were made on scratch copies and are not in the ZIP.
  Not run: actually submitting a form (it would POST to the form service), so the real redirect back with the
  parameter was simulated by loading the URL directly.
Next/open: migrate the part-boxes order confirmation (partBoxOrder.js, still `.notify-success` with the old
  green border and an h3) to `.success-state` when part-boxes is walked; the hero on contact.html?sent=true
  still says "Choose what fits below..." (copy, waits for the copy pass); custom-build deferred items and the
  sitewide scan findings unchanged. Next page to walk: about, gallery, faq or part-boxes (owner picks).

Task: Refresh the stale theming text in ARCHITECTURE.md (Lane B checklist item; docs only, no site code touched).
Files (diff against the A-013 ZIP):
- M ARCHITECTURE.md
- M LOG.md
- M START_HERE.md
Changed:
- ARCHITECTURE.md: header note extended; directory-layout entries for css/tokens.css and css/theme.css rewritten
  (theme.css is the live "Cask" theme, dark-only, loaded last on all 10 pages in pages-src/); "Theming" section
  rewritten (tokens.css holds the old blue defaults + light block, theme.css redefines them; current token
  roles: --accent, --accent-text, --border-field, fonts; rules of thumb); old "Visual redesign ("Forge")"
  section replaced by "Visual redesign history" (Forge = superseded, history in docs-archive; current process
  in VISUAL_REDESIGN.md). Each statement was checked against css/tokens.css, css/theme.css, the <link> order in
  every pages-src/*.html, and VISUAL_REDESIGN.md decisions 9, 13, 14 and A-012.
- START_HERE.md: Last updated / Current state header, B-014 line, Next up -> Lane B item removed, owner queue item 4.
Found, not fixed:
- theme.css does not redefine --success, so tokens.css's light-mode value (#16a34a) would apply for visitors
  whose system is set to light. Visible effect: unknown (not rendered or measured). Visual question, left for Lane A.
- Other stale parts of ARCHITECTURE.md (outside "theming", left alone and put in the owner queue): page list in
  the directory layout omits about.html and part-boxes.html; js/data list omits faq.js, gallery.js,
  partBoxes.js; docs line still lists files now in docs-archive/; "8 HTML files" in the rationale.
- Comment in css/theme.css (decision 14 note) cites "/areas/website-visual-redesign.md", which is not a file in
  this project. Not changed (code comment, not part of this chunk).
Verified: stitch.py exit 0, generated files unchanged (diff of uploaded vs. working project shows only the docs
  above). Not run: smoke-test.js and visual-check.py (no site code or CSS changed; no network here for jsdom).
Next/open: Lane B remaining: Phase 8 maintenance/deployment guide; domain-swap checklist. Lane A: walk about,
  gallery, faq or part-boxes (owner picks).

B-015 | complete | 2026-10-08
Task: (1) fix the dead file-path citation in css/theme.css comments; (2) bring the non-theming stale parts of ARCHITECTURE.md up to date (owner request, following the B-014 findings).
Files (diff against the B-014 ZIP):
- M ARCHITECTURE.md
- M LOG.md
- M START_HERE.md
- M css/theme.css
Changed:
- css/theme.css: comments only, 2 places (decision-14 notes): `/areas/website-visual-redesign.md` -> `VISUAL_REDESIGN.md`.
  No CSS rules touched. The same dead citation also appears in css/style.css (2) and css/build-detail.css (4); not
  changed (owner asked for theme.css only), listed in the owner queue.
- ARCHITECTURE.md: directory layout now lists all 10 generated root pages plus pages-src/ (and says root HTML is
  generated), adds js/data faq.js, gallery.js, partBoxes.js, the current docs files and docs-archive/, favicon.ico,
  smoke-test.js, visual-check.py; gallery.css described as the lightbox only, loaded by gallery.html and index.html
  (checked against the <link> tags; it was listed as gallery.html + build.html); doc references to DECISIONS.md and
  PROJECT_STATUS.md now point into docs-archive/; stitch.py paragraph notes it also writes sitemap.xml/robots.txt
  (404.html excluded), checked against build-tools/stitch.py. Header note updated. Also checked and found accurate, left
  as is: marker names, the PC data-model field names, the media {images, videos} shape, the events fields, the blog
  toggle in config.js, FormSubmit use.
Corrects: B-014. B-014 listed "8 HTML files" in ARCHITECTURE.md's rationale as stale. It is not: that sentence
  describes the OLD site before the rebuild, so it was left unchanged.
Found, not fixed (owner queue item 4): comment in css/gallery.css says "Loaded only by gallery.html" (index.html also
  loads it); comment in js/data/config.js mentions js/render/contactForm.js, which does not exist (contactRouter.js).
Verified: stitch.py exit 0, generated files unchanged (diff shows only the files above). Not run: smoke-test.js and
  visual-check.py (no executable code or CSS rules changed; no network here for jsdom).
Next/open: Lane B remaining: Phase 8 maintenance/deployment guide; domain-swap checklist. Lane A: walk about, gallery,
  faq or part-boxes (owner picks).

B-016 | complete | 2026-10-08
Task: Fix the three leftovers from B-015 (owner approved 1-3): dead path citations, gallery.css header comment, config.js comment.
Files (diff against the B-015 ZIP):
- M LOG.md
- M START_HERE.md
- M css/build-detail.css
- M css/gallery.css
- M css/style.css
- M js/data/config.js
Changed (comments only, no rules or code):
- css/style.css (2) and css/build-detail.css (4): `/areas/website-visual-redesign.md` -> `VISUAL_REDESIGN.md`. No
  occurrences remain in css/ or js/.
- css/gallery.css: header now says it is loaded by gallery.html and index.html (confirmed by the <link> tags).
- js/data/config.js: the comment pointing at the nonexistent js/render/contactForm.js now says what actually happens:
  stitch.py fills {{CONTACT_EMAIL}} into pages-src/contact.html and part-boxes.html (so re-run it after changing the
  email), and js/render/buildDetail.js and notifyBox.js read CONTACT.email at runtime. Checked by grep.
Verified: stitch.py exit 0, generated files unchanged; node --check passes on js/data/config.js. Not run:
  smoke-test.js, visual-check.py (comments only; no network for jsdom).
Next/open: owner has part-box pictures to add (not started). Lane B remaining: Phase 8 maintenance/deployment guide;
  domain-swap checklist.

B-017 | complete | 2026-10-08
Task: Add the owner's part-box photos (11 boxes, one photo each, uploaded as HEIC in Archive.zip).
Files (diff against the B-016 ZIP):
- A images/box-01.jpg ... images/box-11.jpg (11 files)
- M js/data/partBoxes.js
- M LOG.md
- M START_HERE.md
Changed:
- images/: HEIC converted to JPEG with ImageMagick (auto-oriented, EXIF/GPS stripped, longest side max 1800 -> 1350x1800,
  quality 82), 230-400 KB each. Named by box id.
- js/data/partBoxes.js: each of box-01..box-11 gets `media.images: ["images/box-NN.jpg"]`. Nothing else in the file changed.
Mapping used (from file names, checked by looking at each photo): R_5_5500->box-01, R_5_3600->box-02, R_7_5800X3D->box-03,
  MAG_A550BN->box-04, MAG_A650BE->box-05, SE-214-XT-V2->box-06, A520M-PLUS_W (open box, insert visible)->box-07,
  A520M-PLUS (closed, taped)->box-08, B550M-VC-WIFI->box-09, B550-PLUS-AC-HES->box-10, RW_TOWER_SCREEN->box-11.
Flags (owner queue item 4-5): box-03 data says 5700X3D, photo label says 5800X3D (not changed); box-07/08 assignment is
  my reading; box-09 had a second photo (B550M-VC-WIFI_W) that was not added; portrait photos are center-cropped by the
  landscape card frame (visual, Lane A).
Verified: stitch.py exit 0, generated HTML unchanged; node --check passes on partBoxes.js. Real Chromium on a scratch copy
  of part-boxes.html at 1440 and 390 wide: 11 cards, all 11 images loaded (naturalWidth 1350), 0 script errors, no
  horizontal overflow; screenshots viewed (not in the ZIP). Not run: smoke-test.js (npm install jsdom still fails in this
  sandbox: network unreachable), visual-check.py. Not tested: ordering/submitting the part-boxes order form.
Next/open: Lane B remaining: Phase 8 maintenance/deployment guide; domain-swap checklist.

B-018 | complete | 2026-10-08
Task: Part-box follow-ups from the owner's answers to B-017: fix box-03 model, split the B550M listing into with/without inserts, record the no-crop requirement for Lane A.
Files (diff against the B-017 ZIP):
- A images/box-12.jpg
- M images/box-09.jpg
- M js/data/partBoxes.js
- M START_HERE.md
- M VISUAL_REDESIGN.md
- M LOG.md
Changed:
- js/data/partBoxes.js: box-03 model "Ryzen 7 5700X3D" -> "Ryzen 7 5800X3D" (owner: photo label is right; no other
  mention of either model in the site data or pages). box-09 (MSI PRO B550M VC WIFI, includes inserts) quantity 2 -> 1.
  New box-12 (same board, "Good condition. No inserts.", qty 1, $5, same category), placed right after box-09 so the two
  display together. IDs are never reused, so the new box is box-12.
- images/: box-09.jpg is now the B550M_W (with inserts) photo, re-converted from the HEIC with the same settings as
  B-017; box-12.jpg is the plain (no inserts) photo that was box-09.jpg in B-017.
- START_HERE.md: Current state, Next up (new first Lane A item: part-box photos shown portrait, uncropped), owner queue.
- VISUAL_REDESIGN.md: one entry under "Outstanding" recording the owner request (not designed or implemented).
Owner decisions: "_W" in the photo file names means "with inserts" (consistent with the B-017 mapping of box-07/08 and
  box-01/02/04/05); photos stay portrait and uncropped (Lane A designs it).
Flags (owner queue item 4): box-06's photo was a "_W" (with inserts) file but its data says "No inserts" (not changed);
  box-12's condition wording is mine, following the other boxes' pattern.
Verified: stitch.py exit 0, generated HTML unchanged; node --check passes on partBoxes.js. Real Chromium on a scratch copy
  of part-boxes.html at 1440 and 390 wide: 12 cards, all 12 images loaded (1350 px), the two B550M cards adjacent,
  0 script errors, no horizontal overflow. Not run: smoke-test.js (jsdom still cannot be installed here: network
  unreachable), visual-check.py, submitting the order form.
Next/open: Lane B remaining: Phase 8 maintenance/deployment guide; domain-swap checklist.

B-019 | complete | 2026-10-08
Task: Fix box-06's insert status (owner: "with inserts is right").
Files (diff against the B-018 ZIP):
- M js/data/partBoxes.js
- M START_HERE.md
- M LOG.md
Changed:
- js/data/partBoxes.js: box-06 condition "Good condition. No inserts." -> "Good condition — includes inserts." (same wording
  pattern as box-09). Nothing else touched. Owner approved box-12's wording ("Good condition. No inserts.") as is.
- START_HERE.md: Current state, owner queue (the two part-box questions are resolved and removed).
Scan for other small items (read-only, nothing changed): no TODO/FIXME/lorem in site files except the known
  "TODO: replace with a dedicated business email" comment in js/data/config.js; no leftover services/repair mentions apart from
  one disclaimer sentence in js/data/faq.js (copy, for the copy pass) and a history note in css/situation-picker.css; every file
  in images/ is referenced; no empty alt attributes in pages-src. Remaining Lane B items are the two never-written docs.
Verified: stitch.py exit 0, generated HTML unchanged; node --check passes on partBoxes.js. Not run: smoke-test.js (jsdom cannot
  be installed in this sandbox: network unreachable), visual-check.py, any browser render (a one-line text change).
Next/open: Lane B remaining: Phase 8 maintenance/deployment guide; domain-swap checklist. Owner wants to start the copy rewording.

B-020 | complete | 2026-10-08
Task: Plan ahead for the copy rewrite (owner request): evaluate which site text is incorrect or may mislead, then which text has an important role (by style and placement) and is not doing it well. No copy changed.
Files (diff against the B-019 ZIP):
- A COPY_REVIEW.md
- M START_HERE.md
- M LOG.md
Method: read the copy in every pages-src/*.html (incl. titles and meta descriptions), js/partials, js/data/{faq,builds,partBoxes,config,events,gallery}.js
  and the user-visible strings in js/render/*.js; rendered builds.html, gallery.html and index.html in real Chromium on a scratch copy to see the
  actual empty states (all builds are sold). Claims were checked against the data files where possible; the rest are marked unknown.
Result: COPY_REVIEW.md. Part 1: 7 checked errors/contradictions (A), 7 wording that may mislead (B), 4 gaps (C). Part 2: 13 prominent
  texts with a note on idea vs wording. Ends with a suggested order for the copy pass. Owner questions added to START_HERE.md owner queue item 4.
Verified: no site file changed, so stitch.py and the generated HTML are untouched (not re-run: nothing to rebuild). Not run: smoke-test.js (jsdom
  cannot be installed here), visual-check.py. Statements about how search engines see build.html titles, and about FormSubmit/analytics
  behavior, are from reading the code and not tested.
Next/open: Lane B remaining: Phase 8 maintenance/deployment guide; domain-swap checklist. Owner: answer the item-4 facts when ready.

A-021 | complete | 2026-10-09
Task: Part-boxes portrait photo cards (owner-requested; Lane A visual decision; owner approved Option B) and the --success light-mode pin (owner queue item 5).
Files (diff against the uploaded nbpcs_after-B-020.zip):
- M LOG.md
- M START_HERE.md
- M VISUAL_REDESIGN.md
- M css/part-boxes.css
- M css/theme.css
Changed:
- css/part-boxes.css: cards are horizontal, two per row: `.box-grid` is `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(380px, 1fr))`,
  `.box-card` a grid with a 144px photo column, `.box-image` is `aspect-ratio: 3 / 4` with
  `.box-image img { object-fit: contain }` (photos never cropped), `.box-body` a flex column,
  `.box-category` `align-self: flex-start`, `.box-footer` `margin-top: auto` (pins price + quantity to the card
  bottom, which also fixes pickers that did not line up across a row). At 480px and below: one column, 110px
  photo column; at 380px and below: 96px photo column. No markup or JS change; generated HTML unchanged.
- css/theme.css: `--success: #22c55e` pinned with a comment. tokens.css gives --success a different value inside
  a light-mode media query and theme.css never overrode it.
- VISUAL_REDESIGN.md: new "Part-boxes page" section (portrait photo cards; light mode and --success); Scope notes
  updated. START_HERE.md: Current state, Next up (Lane A) and Owner queue (item 5 removed) updated.
Decision: Owner chose Option B (horizontal cards) over A (portrait frame in 3-column cards) and C (keep the 4:3
  frame, whole photo inside it). Options were shown as a published artifact. Owner also reported that the live
  site has no light mode. Deviations to flag: (1) the photo column is 144px, not the 150px shown in the options,
  because the price + quantity row needs 198px and 150px left only ~4px of slack at the 386px card width;
  (2) the first implementation used a 372px grid minimum, which was wrong; fixed to 380px after the width sweep
  showed a wrapped footer at 820px.
Verified: Reconciled Lane B's B-014..B-020 against a real diff of the B-020 ZIP vs my A-013 ZIP: the changed
  files match the logged files exactly, and the CSS/config changes are comment-only (code identical after
  stripping comments). stitch.py exit 0, generated HTML unchanged. smoke-test.js (jsdom installed here): ALL
  CHECKS PASSED. visual-check.py on a scratch copy: no horizontal overflow on any page at desktop/tablet/mobile.
  Real page at 1440/1180/1000/900/840/820/768/641/480/390/360/320px: 0 script errors, no horizontal overflow,
  every photo shown whole, quantity pickers aligned in every row; 12-box grid 1,338px at 1440 (was 1,620px);
  at 360px and 320px the price + quantity row wraps to two lines (price above picker). Quantity buttons add
  boxes, the "Your Request" summary updates and the order form appears. Light mode: light/dark emulation on all
  9 pages gives identical body background and text; only --success differed; after the pin
  `.badge-available` computes rgb(34, 197, 94) under both schemes (checked on a scratch copy with aug26-02
  available, since no real listing is available). Screenshots, the options page and scratch copies are not in
  the ZIP.
Next/open: part-boxes still has the `.qty-input` / `.qty-btn` picker, the sticky order summary panel and the
  `.notify-success` order confirmation in js/render/partBoxOrder.js (migrate to `.success-state`) to walk; about,
  gallery and faq are unwalked; the now-dead light-mode block in css/tokens.css was left alone (owner choice);
  a click-to-enlarge lightbox for the part-box photos is a possible later addition, not done; contact hero copy,
  custom-build deferred items and the sitewide scan findings unchanged.
