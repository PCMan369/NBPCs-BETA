  js/data/gallery.js — Photo Gallery
  ================================================================
  Controls the Gallery page (gallery.html) only. The homepage's
  gallery preview strip does NOT read from this file, despite what
  this comment used to say — it independently pulls straight from
  js/data/builds.js (available builds' own media first, falling back
  to sold builds' media if none are available), in that file's array
  order. Reordering here changes gallery.html; reordering builds.js
  changes the homepage preview. Comment corrected to match reality
  while reordering this file for the owner.

  ================================================================
  HOW TO ADD A PHOTO
  ================================================================
  1. Put the image file in the images/ folder.
  2. Decide which section it belongs to:
       currentBuilds   = systems currently listed or in progress
       completedBuilds = past builds and sold systems
  3. Add an entry to that section:

     {
       src: "images/your-filename.jpg",
       alt: "A short description of what's in the photo"
     },

  4. Save. Both the gallery page and the homepage preview update
     automatically — the homepage just shows the first 3 combined.

  ================================================================
  HOW TO REMOVE OR REORDER A PHOTO
  ================================================================
  Delete the entry to remove it. Cut/paste entries to reorder —
  photos display in the order they appear here.
  ================================================================
